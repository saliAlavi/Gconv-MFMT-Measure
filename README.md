# Gconv-MFMT-Measure
This repo investiages the effectiveness of Gconvs with MFMT measures. To replicate the results first install the [Groupy](https://github.com/adambielski/GrouPy) library, then install the [MFMT](https://github.com/schung039/neural_manifolds_replicaMFT) package instructions. <br />
The main python files are for different networks and the mfmt python files are to replicate the MFMT measures. The results are saved into the temp folder.
